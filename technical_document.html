        <p>
          Electronics is a branch of physics and electrical engineering that deals with the study and application of electrical circuits containing active components, such as semiconductors, transistors, diodes, and integrated circuits. It involves the behavior and movement of electrons in various materials, especially semiconductors like silicon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The field of electronics encompasses a wide range of applications, including the design and analysis of electronic circuits, devices, and systems. Electronic devices, such as computers, smartphones, televisions, radios, and medical equipment, rely on the principles of electronics for their functionality.

        <header>Conduction</header>
        <p>
          Conduction in the context of electricity refers to the movement of electric charge carriers within a material. There are two main types of electrical conduction:
        </p>
        <h4>1.) Conduction in Metals (Electron Conduction):</h4>  
        <ul>
          <li>
            Metals are good conductors of electricity because they have a structure that allows electrons to move freely. In a metal, there is a "sea" of electrons that are not bound to any particular atom and are free to move throughout the material.
          </li></br>
          <li>
            When an electric potential (voltage) is applied across a metal conductor, electrons drift in response to the electric field, creating an electric current.
          </li></br>
        </ul>
        <h4>2.) Conduction in Electrolytes (Ionic Conduction):</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In electrolytes, such as solutions containing ions (charged particles), electrical conduction occurs through the movement of ions.
          </li></br>
          <li>
            Positively charged ions (cations) move toward the negatively charged electrode (cathode), and negatively charged ions (anions) move toward the positively charged electrode (anode). This movement of ions constitutes an electric current.
          </li></br>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>3.) Conduction in Semiconductors:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Semiconductors have properties that are intermediate between conductors and insulators. The conduction in semiconductors is primarily due to the movement of charge carriers, electrons, and holes (vacancies where an electron is missing).
            </li></br>
            <li>
              The conductivity of semiconductors can be altered by introducing impurities or by applying an external electric field. This property is fundamental to the operation of electronic devices like transistors.
            </li></br>
          </ul>
        <h4>4.) Conduction in Gases (Gaseous Conduction):</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Gases can conduct electricity under certain conditions, such as when the electric field is strong enough to ionize the gas molecules, creating free electrons and positive ions.
          </li></br>
          <li>
            This process is known as ionization, and the resulting ionized gas can conduct electricity.
          </li></br>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Understanding electrical conduction is crucial in designing and analyzing electrical circuits, as well as in the operation of various electronic devices. The ability of materials to conduct or insulate against electrical current is a fundamental concept in electrical engineering.

        <header>Voltage</header>
        <p>
          Voltage, also known as electric potential difference, is a fundamental concept in electricity. It is a measure of the electric potential energy per unit charge in an electrical circuit. Voltage is often represented by the symbol "V" and is measured in volts (V).
        </p>
        <p>
          In more practical terms, voltage is the force or pressure that drives electric current through a conductor in a closed circuit. It can be thought of as the "push" or "drive" behind the flow of electric charge. The greater the voltage, the more potential energy per unit charge is available to do work in the circuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some key points about voltage:

          </li>
          <h4 id="equation">V = W / q</h4>
          <br>
          where V is the voltage, W is the electric potential energy, and Q is the electric charge.
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <h4>3.) Voltage in a Circuit:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In an electrical circuit, voltage is typically provided by a power source such as a battery or generator. The voltage across a component in a circuit determines the electric potential energy difference between the two ends of that component.
          </li></br>
        </ul>
        <h4>4.) Ohm's Law:</h4>
        <ul>

          </li>
          <h4 id="equation">V = I × R</h4>
          <br>
          This equation describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in a circuit.
        </ul>
        <h4>5.) Polarity:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Voltage has polarity, meaning it has a positive and a negative terminal. The direction of current flow is from the positive to the negative terminal.
          </li></br>
        </ul>
        <h4>6.) Multiple Voltages in a Circuit:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Circuits can have multiple voltage sources, and the total voltage in a closed loop is the sum of the individual voltages.
          </li></br>

      <section class='main-section' id='Amperes'>
        <header>Amperes</header>
        <p>
          Amperes, often abbreviated as "A," is the unit of electric current in the International System of Units (SI). Electric current is the flow of electric charge through a conductor or circuit. The ampere is named after the French physicist André-Marie Ampère, who made significant contributions to the understanding of electromagnetism.
        </p>
        <p>
          One ampere is defined as one coulomb of electric charge passing through a point in a circuit per second. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:
        </p>
        <h4 id="equation">1A=1C/s</h4>
        <p>
          This definition is based on the relationship between electric current, charge, and time. In practical terms, the ampere is used to quantify the rate of flow of electric charge in a circuit. Larger currents are measured in amperes, while smaller currents may be measured in milliamperes (mA) or microamperes (μA), where 1A = 1000mA and 1A=1,000,000μA.

It is one of the three basic electrical quantities, along with voltage (measured in volts) and resistance (measured in ohms), that form the basis of Ohm's Law. Ohm's Law states that the current (I) in a circuit is equal to the voltage (V) divided by the resistance (R), or I = V/R.

          A transistor is a semiconductor device that can be used for amplification, switching, signal modulation, and many other electronic functions. Transistors are fundamental building blocks in modern electronic circuits and are widely used in various applications, ranging from simple audio amplifiers to complex digital processors.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two main types of transistors: bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and field-effect transistors (FETs). Each type has its own subcategories, but the basic function of both is to control the flow of electric current between two terminals by varying the voltage applied to a third terminal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a brief overview of both types:

        <h4>1.) Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT):</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            BJTs have three layers of semiconductor material: the emitter, base, and collector.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are two types of BJTs: NPN (negative-positive-negative) and PNP (positive-negative-positive), which refer to the arrangement of the semiconductor layers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The flow of current between the collector and emitter terminals is controlled by the voltage applied to the base terminal.
          </li>
          <li>
            BJTs are commonly used for analog amplification, switching, and signal amplification.
